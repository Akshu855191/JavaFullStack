Q. Why java is platfrom independnt ?
--> beacause java compiler compile source code into byte code and byte code is platfrom independent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--> Java is case sesitive programing laguage.

# Java Architecture  					
 Java Component - JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
- Java Virtual Machine which is used to interpret an entire program line by line.
- JVM has a following tasks :-
  1. Load code
  2. Varify code
  3. Execute code

//notes
1. In java combines oth the approaches of compilation and iterpretation.
2. JVM is implemetation of JRE(Java Run time environment)
3. JVM contains class loaders, byte code varifier and execution engine.
# There are three types of class loaders
1. bootrap class loaders.
2. Extension class loaders.
3. Application class loaders

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JRE :- Java Rutime Environment
- JRE stads for Java Rutime Environment.
- It plays a key role while executig any java application.
- It is a application of tool that together allow the
  development of application and provides a rutime environmet. 	

#notes
1. JRE is mainly used for execute java application.
2. JRE contains set of libaries which help to create executale 
   environment	for develop java application.
3. JRE is platform dependent.
4. JVM is the part of JRE.			

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
JDK :- Java Developmet Kit
- JDK stands for java developmemt kit.
- In order to create compile and run a java program you would need JDK installed on your computer.

JDK
1. JDK is used for develop,modify java applications.
2. JDK is Platform dependent.
3. By using Jdk we can develop mobile gaming desktop and enterprise level applications
4. JDK contains JRE+ compiler and private JVM.
5. JDK is the developer side development software.

Java Platform Editions
JME(Java Micro Edition):
- It is useful for developing small devices like mobile phones.

JSE (Java Standard Edition):
- It is useful for GUI database access, networking, and security.--->This is the base and this is first developed ///

JEE(Java Enterprise Edition):
- It is an enterprise platform which is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java Micro Edition (java ME)
Java platform Micro edition Java ME java ME Is a platform for developing applications for resourse constrained devices such as mobile phones embedded system and other samll
devices.
Its designed to provide a flexible and portable environment for developing software on devces with limited memory processing power and display capabilities.


-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Core Java(J2SE)
java platform standard edition j2se is a computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environment.
core java is a application of adavance java 

Advance Java (J2EE)
Java enterprise edition j2ee now known as jakarta EE is a platform for developing and deploying large scale distributed enterprise applications.
it provides tools and frameworks for builing secure scalable and portable applications in server environments.

Applications of Java
Stanalone Applications:-
Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications.

Web Applications:-
An Applications that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application.

Enterprise Applications: An applications thatis distributed in nature such as banking applications etc, is called an enterprise applications.

Mobile Applications:- only mobile application we can make use.

Real Worlds applications of java
- A application develop by nasa using java called world wild allow you to zoom into the outer 
  space. Also, can explore any location earth.	
- An open source framework associated with big data called Hadoop is written in java.			
- by migline the scince of robotics with java program.
