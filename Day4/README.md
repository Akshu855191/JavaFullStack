OPERATORS :- 

- In java,operators are used for evaluation of expression.
- Opearators in java is a symbol that is used to perform operation.
- Java supports the following types of operators.

  1. Unary Operator
  2. Arithmetic Operator
  3. Shift Operator
  4. Relational Operator
  5. Bitwise Operator
  6. Logical Operator
  7. Ternary Operator
  8. Assignment Operator


1. Unary operators:-
- The java unary operators require only one oprand to perform any operation like :
- (++) Incrementing a value by one
- (--) Decrement a value by one
- (!) Negative an expression
-(~) Inverting the value of a boolean

2. Arithmatic operators:-
- Java Arithematic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.
- basic arithematic operators are :-
  1. (+) Addition
  2. (-) Sustraction
  3. (*) Multiplication
  4. (/) Division
  5. (%) Modulo
- Example :- int a = 20; int c = 30;
  a+c, a-c, a*c, a/c, a%d

3. Shift operators

- Shift operators are used to shift the bits of a number left to right.
- It shifted the binary numbers right to left.
- Dasic shift oprators are :
  1. (>>) Signed right shift operator
  2. (>>>) Unsigned right shift operator
  3. (<<) Signed left shift operator
  4. (<<<) Unsigned left shift operator

4. Relational operators 

- The relationaloperators are used to determine the relationship between the operators.
- There are following relational operators.
  1. (==) Relational operators equals to
  2. (!=) not equal to
  3. (<) less than
  4. (>) greater than
  5. (>=) Greater than or equalto
  6. (<=) :ess than or equalto
- Example : int a = 20;
            int b = 10;
        a==b, a!=b, a<b, a>b, a>=b, a<=b

5. Bitwise operators

- Bitwise operator performs bit by bit operation.
- Basic bitwise operator are:-
  1. Bitwise OR operator (|)
  2. Bitwise AND operator (&)
  3. Bitwise XOR operator (^)
  4. Bitwise Complement operator (~)

6. Logical oprators

- Logical operators is used with biary value.
- Logical operators are :-
  1. (&&) logical operator AND
  2. (||) logical operator OR
  3. (!) logical operator Not
- Example :- int a = 20(0001 0100); int c = 10;(0000 1010);
              a&&c, a||c, a!c

7. Ternary operators

- The operators is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement.
- Ternary operator consists of three operands.
- Syntax : condition?value1:value2.
- Example: int num = 10?100:200;
- if the aove example is true than the value1 (100) before the colon(:) is assigned to 
  the variale num else the value2(200) is assigned to the num.

8. Assignmet operator

- It is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left and then storing the 
  result to the left operator.
- Some Assignmet operator are :-
  1. (+=) to add the right and left operand.
  2. (-=) to sustarct the right and left operand. 
     (*=) to multiply the right and left operand. 
     (/=) to divide the right and left operand. 
     (^=) to raise the value of left to the power of right. 
     (%=) to apply divide modulus operator.
- Example : a+=c, a-=c, a*=c, a/=c, a^=c, a%=c.
