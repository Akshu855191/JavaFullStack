#Module Objective

The objective of this cource is you undestand
1. Data Types  Decide --->>>   1.range of variable    2.type of variable   3.size of variable  
2. Variables  : Variable is like a container. It is used to store the data.

1] Data types :-
- Data types in java define the type of information that a variable can hold.
- In simple words, when we declare a variable in java then it is necessary to tell the data type 
  of that variable means which kind of value that variable is going to store.
- In java data types are divided into two type
  . Primitive data type 
  . Non- primitive data types

. Primitive Data Types
- Java developers included these data types to maintain the portalitiy if java as size of
  these primitive data type does not chage from oe OS to nother.
- They are also useful for data manipulation.
- There are eight primitive data type in java
 1. byte
 2. short
 3. int
 4. long
 5. char
 6. float
 7. double
