- JAVA CLASSESS AND OBJECTS
  Objective :-
  1. Java Classes and objects
  2. Characteristics of class
  3. Characteristics of object
  4. Packages in java
  5. Java Access Modifiers.

 1. Java classess and objects :-

  - Class is blueprint of object.
  - Class is plan which is used to construct the object.
  - Class define behaviour of an object.
  - We cant create class as static. Only inner class we can create as a static.
  - We can create a class using java keywords.
  - By default access specifier is defaul.
  - class name first letter should be capital.
  - class is a collection of constructor,methods,variable.
  - We can used 4 access modifiers with class.


  - A class contains variables and methods
  - The class keyword is used to declare a class. 

  Characteristic of class :- Methods
  - Methods should be declareinside the class.
  - It should be defined by methods name followed by ().
  - There are two types of methods in class static and instance
  - There are three types of variable in class 1.local variable 2. instance variable, 3.static variable.
       Advantages :-
   1. Code reusability methods means we can used code many times by declaring only once.
   2. Code optimization methods means we can reduse the line of code.


   - Methods :- In java, a method  is like a function, runs when it calls. Methods can be called anywhere in the program.

   characteristics of constaructor :-
   - It is block of code similar to the method. It is a special type of method. 
     Every class contains a minimum of one constructor. Constructor namemust be same as its class name.
   - Syntax :- public class Chair{
               public Chair(){
               // initialize objects
               }
               } 

   Advantages :-
   1. Code reusability methods means we can used code many times by declaring only once.
   2. Code optimization methods means we can reduse the line of code.

  

2. Object :-
  - Object is an instancve of a class.
  - Object is runtime entity.
  - We can create object by using new keyword 
  - We can used object to access the functionality of class.
  - Syntax :- Classname reference variable = new classname();
  - Example :- Classroom cr = new Classroom();

- Characteristics of objects :-
  - Every object has some characteristics like name,method, etc.
  - An object carry";-
     1. State :-
     2. Behaviour
     3. Identity
  - E.g :- object:- Car
  - Car is an object.
  - Object name is car,
